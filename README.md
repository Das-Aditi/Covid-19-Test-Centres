# Covid-19-Test-Centres
This mini project focuses on the design and implementation of a Database Management System (DBMS) tailored for COVID-19 test centers. 

This system will make it easier for staff to keep track of patients and appointments, ensure tests are allocated properly, update test results quickly, and monitor inventory levels. It will also provide useful reports about testing activities.

Key functionalities of the system include patient registration, sample tracking, test scheduling, result reporting, and inventory management.

Additionally, the system supports reporting features, enabling administrators to monitor testing trends and  resource utilization.

Overall, this mini project demonstrates the importance and feasibility of utilizing a dedicated DBMS for COVID-19 test centers, facilitating smoother operations, improved data management, and enhanced decision-making capabilities in the ongoing fight against the pandemic.
